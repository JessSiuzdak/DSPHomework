%Problem1
%Write a Matlab function whose syntax is x = ar(a,sig,L) that produces a length L realization
%of an autoregressive process with parameters a and σ such that
%x(n)+ a(1)x(n −1)+ a(2)x(n −2)+...+ a(M)x(n − M) = v(n)
%where v(n) is a white noise process with variance σ
%2
%. Hand in a plot of a realization you created with a(1) =
%−0.9, a(2) = 0.7, and zero otherwise. σ = 0.5, and L = 200. Note: you should assume the process begins with
%x(−1) = ··· = x(−M) = 0, but these zeros should not be included in the output.
